# discuss.btall.fr

Simple repository to host the commenting system managed by [`giscus/giscus`](github.com/giscus/giscus) for the [`btall.fr`](https://www.btall.fr/) blog!  
[`Giscus.app`](github.com/giscus/giscus) requires at least a "public" github repository with the "Github Discussion" feature enabled. This is why `discuss.btall.fr` was born. :)
